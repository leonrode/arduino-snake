# arduino-snake
A snake implementation on an Arduino Mega 2560 and an 8x8 LED matrix with a Dual-Axis Joystick, featuring my [BetterJoystick](https://github.com/lionrocker/better-joystick) library.

## Introduction

This sketch utilizes an 8x8 LED Matrix and a dual-axis joystick to control and display the snake game. It uses my custom-written [BetterJoystick](https://github.com/lionrocker/better-joystick) library to interface the dual-axis joystick.
